    "text": "Data Scientists vs Statisticians\nThe difference between data scientists and statisticians is statisticians usually deal with smaller sets of data and focus on applying standard models to them in order to explore the data. Meanwhile, data scientists typically deal with larger sets of data and focuses on cleaning and preparing the data to bring to the model. In this way, data scientists work more closely with the collection and production of data than statisticians in order to properly prepare it for modeling."

In my work, I am able to apply models to data I work with in order to analyze it. However, I am hoping to learn more about data science and different programming languages so that I can be a part of the data production side, such as collection and cleaning data."
